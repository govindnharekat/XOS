An operating sy
stem (OS) is a 
collection of s
oftware that ma
nages computer 
hardware resour
ces and provide
s common servic
es for computer
 programs. The 
operating syste
m is a vital co
mponent of the 
system software
 in a computer 
system. Applica
tion programs u
sually require 
an operating sy
stem to functio
n.

Time-sharing op
erating systems
 schedule tasks
 for efficient 
use of the syst
em and may also
 include accoun
ting for cost a
llocation of pr
ocessor time, m
ass storage, pr
inting, and oth
er resources.

For hardware fu
nctions such as
 input and outp
ut and memory a
llocation, the 
operating syste
m acts as an in
termediary betw
een programs an
d the computer 
hardware,[1][2]
 although the a
pplication code
 is usually exe
cuted directly 
by the hardware
 and will frequ
ently make a sy
stem call to an
 OS function or
 be interrupted
 by it. Operati
ng systems can 
be found on alm
ost any device 
that contains a
 computerâ€”fro
m cellular phon
es and video ga
me consoles to 
supercomputers 
and web servers
.
